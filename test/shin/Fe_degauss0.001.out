     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     216 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from Fe.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= SLA+PW
                           (   1   4   0   0   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want

     Message from routine volume:
     axis vectors are left-handed

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
